## :scroll: Project description
End to end real-time AI workflows are challenging due to the orchestration of various stages: (1) data acquisition, curation, labelling, postprocessing, (2) model train, validation, optimisation and deployment and (3) design of appropriate graphical user interfaces.

During two-days of hacking activities, instructors and participants aim to achieve four learning outcomes: (1) train and test light-weight UNET and UNET-ViT models for segmentation of the public MOBIOUS dataset using python-base libraries, (2) learn good software practices for contributing to open-source projects in compliance with medical device software standards (IEC 62304) using GitHub features, (3) optimise and deploy real-time models using NVIDIAâ€™s AI sensor processing SDK for low latency streaming workflows (holoscan-sdk), and (4) work together to design a simple eye-tracking application or fun game that demonstrates the advantages of real-time AI workflows in analysing eye pathologies and movement.

Our goal is to bring together researchers, engineers, and clinicians from various departments to collaborate on hacking end-to-end real-time AI workflows, including development, evaluation, and integration. We also aim to foster collaborations and contributions that could lead to co-authorship in the development of our real-time AI workflow.

## :computer: Pre-requisites for participants  
* Participants are required to bring their own computers, either with a CPU or GPU. Computers with GPUs are ideal for prototyping models.
* We will also provide notebooks for prototyping models in Google Colab, which offers GPU support. A Google account will be required to access them.
* GitHub username (or [sign up](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) for a GitHub account if you donâ€™t have one).
* Generate your SSH keys by following the instructions provided [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
* Open a terminal in your project directory (e.g., 'repositories') and clone the repository by entering or copying the following commands:
```
git clone git@github.com:UCL/ready.git
```
