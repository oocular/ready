* MOBIUS (Mobile Ocular Biometrics In Unconstrained Settings) is a publicly available dataset primarily intended for mobile ocular recognition research. It was developed at the University of Ljubljana in 2019. It consists of 16,717 RGB images collected from 100 subjects. The images are high-resolution and were captured with the cameras of 3 different commercial mobile phones — Sony Xperia Z5 Compact, Apple iPhone 6s, and Xiaomi Pocophone F1. https://sclera.fri.uni-lj.si/datasets.html Contact point: matej.vitek@fri.uni-lj.si.
